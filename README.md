# GC-Data-Analysis
This repository includes ipynb files of the data analysis performed on Gas Chromatography data obtained from the internet.
Three different fractions i.e. Distilled oil, Gasoline and Saturates data was obtained and cleaned thoroughly 
to make it suitable for performing data analysis using Python libraries like Numpy and Pandas.
Beautiful and insightful graphs were drawn using the highly useful library, Plotly in Python.
